# TODO

- For injected files use EXT\_(ID)\_ instead of EXT\_ in the case of multiple extensions
- Make a seperate TSConfig and bundle for the .inject.ts
- Rename .inject.ts to .browser.ts
- Instead of making a proxy frontend myself, I will port Firefox's XUL (Actual internal code) to run inside of a website, and emulate its features through the proxy. You can see this code with control+alt+shift+i
- Finish all apis
