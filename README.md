# Middleware

The folders here provide extensions to aero's functionality. They are standardized and work across other proxies that implement the [standard](https://github.com/ProxyHaven/Middleware-Spec). These will probably move into a [new repo](https://github.com/ProxyHaven/Middleware).

# Projects

## Extension Emulator (WIP)

Brings webextension support allowing for extensions to be unblocked and work under a proxy.

## Userscripts (WIP)

A very-compatible userscript manager

## AG

Adguard Support

## WebRecorder (WIP)

A new type of archiver that works by recording requests, and api endpoints are learned. I will work on a prototype in the future which includes storage, replayability, and more importantly sharing.

## No Injects

Prevents network-filters from injecting client-side spyware into the sites keeping you more secure.

## Sydney

Supports Bing AI outside of Bing by spoofing the user-agent. Yes, I did this [before Vivaldi](https://www.xda-developers.com/vivaldi-61-support-bing-chat-pretending-microsoft-edge/).

## ChangeLang

Force the language of your choice. This is needed, since server locations often determine the language.

## Third Party extensions

(Waiting for you guys ðŸ˜‰)...
